# Master Thesis 2024 - Raphael Vicini
## Universal Synthetic-CT and Quality Assurance

This GitHub repository consolidates all the code used for my Master's Thesis as a student in Biomedical Engineering at ULB Polytechnique. The source code originates from various GitHub repositories; please refer to the credits in the accompanying README in UGATIT_PYTORCH folder and AUGMENTED_CYCLEGAN folder.

### Thesis Objective
The primary goal of my Master's Thesis is to enhance radiotherapy treatment protocols by leveraging MRI-only workflows. This method not only protects patients from the harmful effects of unnecessary CT scans but also simplifies the treatment process by removing the complex registration steps between CT and MRI scans.


### Modifications 
The code has been  modified to meet the specific requirements of my thesis,  focusing on converting MR images to synthetic CT images for biomedical applications. 


### Contributions and Use
This repository is intended for academic and research purposes. I welcome contributions and feedback to further refine and expand the functionalities of the implemented models.
