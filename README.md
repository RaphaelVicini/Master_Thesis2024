# Master Thesis 2024 - Raphael Vicini
## Universal Synthetic-CT and Quality Assurance

This GitHub repository consolidates all the code used for my Master's Thesis as a student in Biomedical Engineering at ULB Polytechnique. The source code originates from various GitHub repositories; please refer to the credits in the accompanying README.

### Modifications and Purpose
The code has been  modified to meet the specific requirements of my thesis. These modifications aim to enhance radiotherapy treatment by integrating an MRI-only workflow, thereby reducing patient exposure to CT scans traditionally used in radiotherapy. Essentially, this approach eliminates the need for registration between CT and MRI images, streamlining the treatment process.

### Thesis Objective
The primary goal of my Master's Thesis is to enhance radiotherapy treatment protocols by leveraging MRI-only workflows. This method not only protects patients from the harmful effects of unnecessary CT scans but also simplifies the treatment process by removing the complex registration steps between CT and MRI scans.

### Contributions and Use
This repository is intended for academic and research purposes. I welcome contributions and feedback to further refine and expand the functionalities of the implemented models.
